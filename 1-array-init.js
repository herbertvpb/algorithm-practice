// The "Array Initialization" exercise is a simple introductory exercise that helps you 
// become familiar with creating an array in JavaScript and printing its contents to the console. 

// Here's a more detailed explanation:

// Exercise Description:

// 1 - Create an array: In this exercise, you are required to create an array in JavaScript. 
// The array should contain the names of your favorite fruits. For example:

// const favoriteFruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "strawberry", "mango"];

// 2 - Printing to the console: Once you have created the array, you should use a console.log()
// statement to print the entire array to the console. This will display the list of your favorite fruits.

// Expected result: [ "apple", "banana", "orange", "strawberry", "mango" ]

const favoriteFruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "strawberry", "mango"];

function showFavoriteFruits() {
    console.log(favoriteFruits);
}

showFavoriteFruits();
